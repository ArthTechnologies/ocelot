Arth Technologies has [open sourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) all projects available for public use, so data handling is easily verifiable.

## Your data on Arth Hosting
- The only data in your account that is tied to you is your email and account name if you sign in with a service like Discord. 
- Passwords and IP addresses are hashed, meaning that we can't see them, nor can hackers in the unlikely event of a data breach. As with any Minecraft server, raw IP addresses may end up in logs, but those will not be accessed by our systems.
- When you delete a server or account you've made, all its data will be immediately deleted.

### Consent

By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions. 

### Cookies

Like most other websites, our website stores certain data on your browser to provide basic features like light/dark mode, using accounts, and other preferences. They are not stored in the cloud but on your computer, so you can delete them from your browser.

### Third Parties

We try to minimize third parties whenever possible for privacy and efficiency.

- Source Code: Like almost all companies, we use a third-party service to host our underlying computer code / source code. On Dec 1, 2022, we switched from Microsoft-owned GitHub to Codeberg, an open-source website governed by Codeberg e.v, a democratic organization based in the European Union. Codeberg's privacy policy can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/PrivacyPolicy.md).
- Payment Processing: Our payment processing partner, Stripe, is required by some countries to comply with "Know Your Customer" laws, which may include addresses and legal names. Arth only accesses the last four digits of your credit card and your email from Stripe. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://stripe.com/privacy).

5. Clicks on the "Get Started" button

This data is not bundled into a profile of you specifically. You can opt-out by enabling do not track in your browser settings.
