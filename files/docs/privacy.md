# Your data on Arth Hosting

- When you delete a server you've made, all data relating to that server will be immediately deleted.
- The data tied to your account is your email, your password, what servers you own.

# Consent

By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms and Conditions. 

# Cookies

Like most other websites, our websites use 'cookies', data that is stored on your browser, to provide basic features like light/dark mode, using accounts, and other preferences. They are not stored in the cloud but on your computer, so you can delete them from your browser.

# Third Parties

We try to minimize third parties whenever possible for privacy and efficiency's sake. Third party tools used by many websites such as Google AdSense are the primary collectors of data, so we are especially focused on minimizing their roles in our services.

### Web Hosting

Most hosting services such as AWS collect all IP Addresses, Data & Time, and more as part of their analytics. We currently host our own websites, so your IP Address and other info will not be available to anyone besides us.

### Source Code Hosting

Source code hosting is used by almost everyone who is developing software, including us. Normally the service used is GitHub, a proprietary website owned by Microsoft based in the United States of America. Since December 1st, 2022, Arth has been exclusively using Codeberg, an open-source website governed by Codeberg e.v, a democratic organization based in the European Union. Codeberg's privacy policy can be found [here](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/PrivacyPolicy.md)

### Analytics

Arth collects two pieces of information to better know how many people are using its services:

1. Your Platform (Ex: iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, Mac)
2. Your Language (Ex: En_Us, Es_Es)

If your browser sends a do not track signal, your analytics will not be collected. Additionally, you can also opt-out of analytics by setting "allowAnalytics" in local storage to false using your browser's developer tools.

Your analytics are only collected by Arth and do not go through a third party such as Google Analytics.

### Ads

Ads currently would serve no purpose on our websites and services, but if the need arises for them in the future, we will avoid Google AdSense and will likely use the upcoming [AdRinth](https://adrinth.com) network.




Changes to these terms:
- If changes to these terms are needed, we will put them into effect a month after the changes are made visible.
