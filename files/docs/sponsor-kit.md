# YouTube Sponsorships

## Guidelines

1. Sponsored segment must be no shorter than 15 seconds, and no longer than 45 seconds (We reccomend keeping the segment under 25 secoonds).

2. You must point out at least one major selling point found on our website or youtube channel. Examples of these include our price to performance, automatic geyser setup, or one-click worldgen mods. Otherwise, the service can come off as generic to viewers.

3. Make sure you properly understand the service before making the segment. Read the website's main page and watch our "Introducing Arth Hosting" youtube video. If there's something you don't understand about the service or why we're a good deal for your viewers, **don't hesitate to ask**.

## Footage

We highly reccomend using our [Introducing Arth Hosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9r_QaqX23M) video as footage during part of or all of your sponsored segment.

Other things that could work well as footage include screenshots from our website such as this:

Or alternatively, images downloaded directly using `Right Click > Save Image As`. 

Here is our logo if you want to put it in a corner of the video:
