# How to let your friends access your server panel

On Arth Hosting you have the ability to let friends access your server panel, allowing them to start, stop, manage plugins, and more for you.

## How to setup

First, have your friend(s) create an account on Arth Hosting. To do this, they can sign up normally and close out the website once it asks for payment. Then, they can type in servers.arthmc.xyz.

After that, they should go to the account page and send their `Account ID`.

The last step is for you to go to the **settings** tab on your panel. Under the **Accounts with Panel Access** section, you will be able to enter the accountID and your friend(s) should now have access.
