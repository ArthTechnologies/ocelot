For years, Minecraft players on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android have all been able to join custom servers, giving them the freedom to check out servers online or buy their own server instead of paying for Realms (which generally costs more and has fewer features than a server from a host). However, players on an Xbox or PlayStation don't have access to that "Add Server" button that can even let you play with friends on Java via Geyser-enabled servers. Thankfully, a team of developers decided to do something about it.

## Xbox & PlayStation: Bedrock Together
[BedrockTogether](https://bedrocktogether.net) is an app available on iOS and Android that creates a local server that is joinable from your console. After you put in an address on the app and click "Watch Ad and Run", all you have to do is open Minecraft on your console and click on the new world that appears in the Friends section. If you experience issues, you can go to their [discord](https://discord.gg/PDEfcUaKFj) for help.

## Nintendo Switch: The DNS Workaround
Unfortunately, BedrockTogether does not currently support Nintendo Switch. However, there has been a method that's worked for many years involving changing your DNS address. DNS is the system that converts a domain name like arthmc.xyz or google.com to a numerical address. There are various DNS servers available that can make a local server appear on your Switch, allowing you to type in an address for a custom server and join it. Due to updates and changing addresses, it's best to find a YouTube tutorial posted within the past year. While it is an imperfect workaround and sometimes doesn't work for a subset of people, it may be worth a shot.

## Possibilities with custom servers
While the minigames offered by the official servers may be good enough for most people, the official servers do not offer the ability to play true survival Minecraft with others or play on an anarchy server. The ability to join custom servers also allows you to buy your own server to play together with friends. While Minecraft Realms is convenient, it is a bad deal compared to most server hosts, as it's $3.99/month and only allows 3 players on at once. Arth Hosting is $3.49/month and allows 20 players at once, has java-bedrock crossplay automatically enabled, worldgen mods, plugins, and countless other features. Learn more on our [home page](/).
